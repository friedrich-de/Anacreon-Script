This script was created by anacreon from the DJT thread. Find his website here: https://anacreondjt.gitlab.io/

Sadly he seems to have disappeared and no longer provide support or updates to the script. In this repository we organize an effort to maintain and improve the script. 

## Installation Instructions

To install the script, place the 'animecards' folder into your mpv scripts folder and the settings into your mpv script-opts folder.

**Windows:**
```
C:/Users/<YourUsername>/AppData/Roaming/mpv/scripts/animecards
C:/Users/<YourUsername>/AppData/Roaming/mpv/script-opts/animecards.conf
```

**Linux (usually):**
```
~/.config/mpv/scripts/animecards
~/.config/mpv/script-opts/animecards.conf
```

**MacOS:**
```
Depends on your mpv installation.
```

### Final Folder Structure
Your directory structure should look like this:
```
mpv/script-opts/
└── animecards.conf

mpv/scripts/animecards
├── anki.lua
├── card_builder.lua
├── clipboard.lua
├── encoder.lua
├── ...
```

⚠️ **Important:**  
Do **not** place the `animecards.conf` file in the `mpv/scripts` folder. It **must** be located in a separate folder: `mpv/script-opts/`
